//! TypeScript/TSX Type Stripper
//!
//! Removes TypeScript type annotations from source code, producing
//! JavaScript that the zts parser can handle. Preserves line/column
//! positions by replacing stripped spans with spaces.
//!
//! Supported:
//! - type/interface declarations (stripped entirely)
//! - import type / export type (stripped entirely)
//! - Variable/param/return annotations (: Type)
//! - as / satisfies assertions
//! - Generic parameters on functions/types
//!
//! Unsupported (errors):
//! - angle-bracket assertions in TSX (<T>expr)
//! - `any` type annotations
//!
//! Note: enum, namespace, implements, decorators, access modifiers, class,
//! and abstract class are all handled by the parser for one consistent error
//! path after TypeScript preparation (see zts/parser/parse.zig)

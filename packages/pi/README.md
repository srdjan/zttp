# pi

The coding agent behind the `zttp expert` and `zttp ledger` CLI commands.
Linked only into the developer `zttp` binary, never into the pi-free `zts`
analyzer binary or the deployed `zttp-runtime`. Built in Zig against local MLX
Chat Completions, Anthropic Messages, and OpenAI Responses APIs, driven by a
pure turn state machine with a compiler-aware tool registry and a mandatory
compile-check veto on every edit.

Companion to Mario Zechner's TypeScript [pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono).
Ported to Zig, scoped to this repo's lockdown policy: everything the
agent knows or does is baked into the binary at build time.

## Why

The agent's job is narrow:

1. Read a workspace.
2. Propose an edit in response to user intent.
3. Prove the edit passes every compiler rule before it lands.

Step three is the moat. The agent runs `edit_simulate` in-process
before any apply, and `verify_paths` + `review_patch --diff-only` after
apply. The model cannot emit text that bypasses the check.

## Lockdown policy

Nothing loaded at runtime that was not in the source tree at build
time. Each surface has exactly one source:

| Surface            | Single source                                       |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Tools              | `app.zig:buildRegistry()`                           |
| Slash commands     | `const` table in `commands.zig`                     |
| Skills             | `@embedFile` + comptime parse of `skills/*.md`      |
| Prompt templates   | `@embedFile` + comptime parse of `prompts/*.md`     |
| Models             | `providers/models.zig`                              |
| System prompt      | `expert_persona.buildSystemPromptWithContext`       |

Adding to any of these requires a rebuild. No `~/.zttp/models.json`
loader, no `SYSTEM.md` or `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` override, no dynamic
library loading.

The one external input that reaches the system prompt is
`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`, walked up from cwd to `.git/`. The loader
appends it as a labelled read-only project-context section; persona
text stays intact above. A hard 128 KiB cap on the assembled prompt
truncates the project-context section first on overflow.

`test_support/lockdown.zig` enforces the policy mechanically: a
build-time seal test walks the source tree and fails if any `.zig`
file contains `~/.zttp/{skills,prompts,extensions,models.json}`,
`SYSTEM.md`, `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`, `dlopen`, `dlsym`, or `LoadLibrary`.

## Key features

### Compile-in-the-loop veto (`veto.zig`)

The loop rejects every proposed edit whose `edit_simulate.simulate()`
run reports a new violation. Pre-existing violations do not block new
edits, only newly introduced ones. Failures feed back as a `retry_draft`
turn event.

### Expert workflow hints (`expert_workflow.zig`)

Before the first model call for a turn, the host classifies common asks
such as route additions, proof goals, SQL work, JWT auth, and violation
repair. High-confidence matches append an `[expert workflow]` system note
to the transcript with the compiler-native tool route to try first. This
costs no model round-trip and does not authorize edits; every candidate
still goes through the compiler veto.

### Goal candidates (`tools/pi_goal_candidate.zig`)

`pi_goal_candidate` is a non-writing wrapper for supported deterministic
repairs. It calls `pi_repair_plan`, dry-runs repair intents through
`pi_apply_repair_plan`, and returns `proposed_content` only after
`edit_simulate` reports zero new violations. The model must still apply
those bytes through `apply_edit` or another vetoed writer.

### Post-apply verification (`loop.zig:postApplyCheck`)

After an edit lands, `verify_paths` and `review_patch --diff-only` run
against the touched file. The loop logs any new violation that should
have been caught by the veto as a regression signal.

### Project context (`context/project_context.zig`)

Walks cwd upward to `.git/` (inclusive). At each level reads `AGENTS.md`
then `CLAUDE.md` if present. Concatenates outer-first with path
headings. Caps: 64 KiB per file, 512 KiB total, 128 KiB final prompt.
Suppress with `--no-context-files`.

### Policy-hash drift detection (`agent.zig:injectDriftNote`)

`meta.json` stamps the `policy_hash` computed from `zts.policyHash()`
at session create. On `--resume`, if the binary's current hash differs
from the stamped one, `injectDriftNote` prepends a `[policy drift]`
system_note to the transcript so the model knows prior rule citations
may be stale against today's compiler.

### Session persistence (`session/`)

`$HOME/.zttp/sessions/<cwd_sha256>/<session_id>/` carries
`meta.json`, `workspace.txt`, and append-only `events.jsonl`. `--resume`
reconstructs the transcript; `--fork` branches with `parent_id`;
`--continue` is an alias for `--resume`. `$ZTTP_SESSIONS_DIR`
overrides the root (used by tests).

### `--mode rpc` (line-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0)

`zttp expert --mode rpc` exposes the agent over stdio for programmatic
clients. Methods: `turn`, `compact`, `session.info`, `tools.list`,
`tools.invoke`, `skills.list`, `templates.{list,expand}`,
`model.{list,set}`, `shutdown`. Turn events emit as `"event"`
notifications using the same `{v,k,d}` envelope as `events.jsonl`.

### CLI REPL

`zttp expert` runs a line-buffered CLI REPL for interactive work.
Natural-language lines go to the model; slash commands route to local
compiler tools, session management, skills, templates, and ledger export.
Non-interactive integrations use `--print`, `--mode json`, or
`--mode rpc`.

Proof deltas and witness details are persisted as session events. Inspect
them with `/ledger export <path>`, `zttp ledger`, `/witnesses <handler.ts>`,
or the browser proof workbench surfaced by `/studio <handler.ts>`.

### Backends

`providers/local/` implements non-streaming Chat Completions for the exact
`LiquidAI/LFM2.5-2.6B-MLX-8bit` model. The default endpoint is
`http://127.0.0.1:8080`; `ZTTP_MLX_BASE_URL` accepts only credential-free HTTP
loopback roots. Readiness checks call `/health` and `/v1/models`. The adapter
prefers structured tool calls, strictly normalizes Liquid's raw tool envelope,
discards reasoning fields, and never retries another provider.

`providers/anthropic/` implements the Messages API with SSE streaming,
ephemeral prompt caching on the system block, and usage token
accounting (`input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_read_input_tokens`,
`cache_creation_input_tokens`).

`providers/openai/` implements the Responses API with SSE streaming and the
same `turn.AssistantReply` boundary.

`providers/deepseek/` implements the same non-streaming Chat Completions shape
as the local adapter, over HTTPS with a bearer key. `providers/chat_completions.zig`
holds the request body writer both share; what differs is the endpoint policy
(local requires a plain-HTTP loopback root, DeepSeek requires an HTTPS root
carrying no credential), authentication, and decoding. DeepSeek assigns its own
tool-call ids, so replay needs no request digest, and it emits no raw tool
envelope. `reasoning_content` and `reasoning` are discarded before capture.

The static registry tags every model with its provider. Local defaults to
`LiquidAI/LFM2.5-2.6B-MLX-8bit`, Anthropic to `claude-sonnet-4-6`, OpenAI to
`gpt-4o-mini`, and DeepSeek to `deepseek-v4-flash`.

Provider resolution is explicit launch flags, stored resume or fork identity,
then the current DeepSeek default. Cloud keys do not influence selection. New sessions
store provider and model identity; `/new` keeps the process provider and current
model. In-process resume refuses a different provider and leaves the current
session unchanged.

Model IDs select within the active provider and never change providers.
`--model`, `/model`, and RPC `model.set` all use the same exact registry lookup.
`/model` and RPC `model.list` show only the active provider's entries. A switch
lasts for the current session and applies the registry request budget. The
OpenAI entry records a 16,384-token output capability but keeps zttp's
8,192-token request policy.

The model client is a vtable (`loop.ModelClient = {context, request_fn}`), so
the loop stays provider-agnostic. `CannedClient` and `SequenceClient` exercise
the same boundary in tests without network access.

## CLI

See the top-level `README.md` for the full flag list. The ones specific
to pi:

```
--resume                 reload newest session for this cwd
--continue               alias for --resume
--session-id <id>        explicit session id
--fork <id>              branch an existing session
--no-session             ephemeral session (no persistence)
--no-persist-tool-output skip tool_result events in events.jsonl
--no-context-files       skip AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md walk
--yes                    auto-approve all verified edits
--no-edit                auto-reject all verified edits
--tools {full,minimal}   tool preset (minimal = workspace read-only)
--provider <name>        local, claude, or openai for this launch
--model <id>             model registered for the active provider
--print <prompt>         one-shot, rendered text to stdout
--mode json              one-shot, NDJSON events to stdout (needs --print)
--mode rpc               long-lived JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio
```

Flag interactions the parser enforces:

- `--resume` / `--continue` / `--session-id` / `--fork` are mutually
  exclusive; each picks a different session-selection strategy.
- `--yes` and `--no-edit` are mutually exclusive; they resolve the
  edit-approval policy to `auto_approve` and `auto_reject` respectively.
- `--mode rpc` and `--print` are mutually exclusive; RPC is long-lived,
  `--print` is one-shot.
- `--mode json` requires `--print`; the JSON event stream only makes
  sense in one-shot mode.
- `--goal` is compiler-only and rejects `--provider` and `--model`.

The parser returns a distinct error variant for each collision so the
stderr message points at the exact bad combination.

Slash commands in the interactive REPL:

```
/help /quit
/new /resume /continue /fork /tree
/compact
/model [<id>]
/skills /skill:<name>
/templates /template:<name> [args...]
/settings
/hotkeys /changelog
```

## Development

Run the pi test suite:

```
zig build test-expert-app
```

Run the full workspace suite:

```
zig build test
```

Add a skill:

1. Create `packages/pi/src/skills/<name>.md` with YAML frontmatter
   carrying `name` and `description`, then the body.
2. Add `@embedFile("<name>.md")` to the `embedded_sources` array in
   `packages/pi/src/skills/catalog.zig`.
3. Rebuild. `/skills` will list it, `/skill:<name>` will invoke it.

Add a tool:

1. Write `packages/pi/src/tools/<name>.zig` exporting `pub const tool: ToolDef = .{ ... }`.
   Set its mandatory `effect` to the strongest effect it can perform:
   `analyze`, `read_workspace`, `execute_process`, `persist_agent_state`,
   or `write_workspace`.
2. `try reg.register(allocator, <name>.tool)` in `app.zig:buildRegistry`.
3. Add a `"<name>"` line to the `expected_names` array in the
   `buildRegistry` test, and the prompt dispatch guide at the top of
   `expert_persona.zig`.
4. Rebuild. Model calls reject `write_workspace`; RPC calls allow only
   `analyze` and `read_workspace`. Model-mediated source writes must use the
   synthetic `apply_edit` tool so the compiler veto and approval policy run.

## Deferred

**Phase 5 (structured `ToolResult` split).** Deliberately skipped. The
current `ToolResult.body` is JSON that Claude reads natively; splitting
into `{llm_text, ui_payload}` would lose structure the model already
uses. Reopen if a future UI needs a typed payload for rendering.

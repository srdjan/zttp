// Saga orchestrator: a sequence of in-process sub-handler calls made atomic by
// reverse-order compensation. Each step's `run` is recorded as a durable step
// "do:<name>"; if a step fails (Response status >= 400) the already-completed
// steps are rolled back in reverse via their `compensate` thunks ("undo:<name>").
// On crash recovery the completed do:/undo: steps replay from the oplog, so the
// rollback is reproduced without re-invoking anything.

//
//   GET /                  -> every step succeeds -> { ok: true }
//   GET /fail              -> "charge" is declined (402) -> "reserve" is compensated
//   GET /compensation-fails -> "charge" is declined AND "reserve"'s own
//                              compensate call is declined too -> the
//                              rollback itself fails. There is no automatic
//                              retry for a failed compensation: it surfaces
//                              as a terminal 500 requiring manual
//                              intervention, since the runtime cannot prove
//                              which side effects were actually undone.
//
// Notes: the handler is left without explicit return-type annotations because
// the step thunks return zttp:workflow.call results (typed `object`), which
// the strict Response-return check would reject (strict-ZigTS is advisory). The
// three branches inline literal charge paths rather than capturing a variable
// in the step thunks, sidestepping a deep-closure upvalue limitation.

//! Proof Trace - per-property reasoning for the proof card.
//!
//! Every handler property the analyzer proves (deterministic, read_only,
//! no_secret_leakage, ...) carries a verdict today but no *reasoning*. This
//! module turns data the analyzer already computed - enumerated paths,
//! fault-coverage counts, flow-checker diagnostics with their counterexample
//! witnesses, and the deterministic-demotion provenance - into a small,
//! legible per-property explanation: how a proof was discharged, or the
//! concrete counterexample that broke it.
//!
//! Pure and freestanding-safe: no filesystem, no clock, no libc. The wasm
//! analyzer build emits the exact same `proofTrace` JSON as `zts check`.

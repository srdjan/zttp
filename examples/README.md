# Examples

Handler files grouped by what they demonstrate. The compiler treats every
example as a complete program: parse, contract, verify, then run. Each
`.test.jsonl` file beside a handler is replayable through `zttp mock`;
build-time replay uses `zig build -Dhandler=<handler> -Dtest-file=<tests>`.
Workflow examples use live server checks in `scripts/test-examples.sh` because
they exercise real durable state, signals, and the persisted workflow queue.

## Start here

These three handlers, in order, are the shortest path to seeing what makes zttp different from a Node runtime.

1. **[handler/spec-guardrails.ts](handler/spec-guardrails.ts)** - the magnet, in 24 lines. The handler declares `Proof<T, "deterministic" | "idempotent" | "no_secret_leakage" | "injection_safe">` on its return type and the compiler discharges all four. Try editing it: drop a `Date.now()` into the body and watch `-deterministic` light up in the proof card with a `Why:` row. Wrap it in `step("ts", () => Date.now())` from `zttp:durable` and the chip flips back green.

2. **[handler/handler-full.tsx](handler/handler-full.tsx)** - the same shape, with branches. JSX rendering, multiple routes, and Result handling across a fuller handler. It returns a plain `Response` (no `Proof<T, P>`), so it does not declare proof obligations; read it after the guardrails example to see the routing surface scale up, then compare with [handler/handler.ts](handler/handler.ts), which carries the `Proof<T, P>` declaration.

3. **[handler/secret-leak.ts](handler/secret-leak.ts)** - see a proof reject your code. Reads `env("SECRET_KEY")` and tries to ship it back in the response body. The flow analyzer catches it before runtime and emits ZTS400. This is the most concrete demo of "the compiler proves what your code is."

After those, the shortest durable workflow path is
**[workflow/dsl-orchestrator.ts](workflow/dsl-orchestrator.ts)**. Read its
proof receipt first, then run it with `--durable` and `--workflow-queue` to see
one stable run key, one queued child boundary, and one inspectable recovery
surface.

## By category

### handler/

The core shape of a zttp handler. Start with the three above, then:

- [handler.ts](handler/handler.ts) - the canonical TS handler with `Proof<T, P>`.
- [handler.tsx](handler/handler.tsx) - the same shape in TSX.
- [handler-with-imports.ts](handler/handler-with-imports.ts) - importing multiple virtual modules.
- [sugar.ts](handler/sugar.ts) - the small syntactic conveniences the model-minimal profile keeps: arrow callbacks, array HOFs, and `Object.keys`. Compound assignment is not one of them, so the counter update is written in full.
- [effects-capsule.ts](handler/effects-capsule.ts) - `Effects<T, "...">` as a handler budget, and the decidable rule for where a helper ceiling goes (ZTS610 and ZTS623).
- [feature-probes.ts](handler/feature-probes.ts) - exact-output probes for runtime language features tracked in the feature matrix.
- [spec-fails-idempotent.ts](handler/spec-fails-idempotent.ts) - a deliberately failing `Proof<T, P>` for the discharge diagnostics path.

### jsx/

JSX without a build step. Use `renderToString(<Component />)` to produce HTML.

- [jsx-simple.tsx](jsx/jsx-simple.tsx) - one component, one route.
- [jsx-component.tsx](jsx/jsx-component.tsx) - components composing other components.
- [jsx-ssr.tsx](jsx/jsx-ssr.tsx) - full server-side rendering pattern.

### routing/

Branch on `req.method` and `req.path`. No external router needed.

- [router.ts](routing/router.ts) - the bare branching style.
- [match-handler.ts](routing/match-handler.ts) - `match` expression for cleaner exhaustiveness.
- [guard-flow.ts](routing/guard-flow.ts) - guards run in order by explicit early return.
- [api-surface.ts](routing/api-surface.ts) - declaring a larger API as a flat object.

### modules/

Calling into the virtual modules (the in-binary stdlib that replaces npm).

- [modules.ts](modules/modules.ts) - imports a handful of modules and uses them in one handler.
- [modules_all.ts](modules/modules_all.ts) - touches several representative virtual modules so the contract extractor exercises auth, validation, cache, and crypto bindings.

### fetch/

Outbound HTTP through the `zttp:fetch` module. Start these examples
with an explicit outbound host allow-list.

- [weather-forecasts.ts](fetch/weather-forecasts.ts) - calls the keyless Open-Meteo API and parses the JSON response.
- [webhook.ts](fetch/webhook.ts) - durable POST forwarding with idempotency-key replay.

### Advanced surfaces

- **durable/** - `run`, `step`, `waitSignal` from `zttp:durable`. Replay-safe execution. See [approval.ts](durable/approval.ts) (illustrative; the gated durable coverage lives in `workflow/`, run live by `scripts/test-examples.sh`).
- **workflow/** - start with [dsl-orchestrator.ts](workflow/dsl-orchestrator.ts) for the embedded workflow DSL path, then use the primitive fixtures for `call`, `fanout`, `follow`, durable workflow queue, signal resume, timeout, and dead-letter replay. See [../docs/durable-workflows.md](../docs/durable-workflows.md).
- **parallel/** - `parallel` from `zttp:io`; both handlers must pass strict
  `check --types` in `scripts/test-examples.sh`.
- **hypermedia/** - [order.ts](hypermedia/order.ts) declares one resource with `resource(data, affordances)` and serves HAL-JSON or an HTMX fragment from the same affordance set, chosen by `Accept` and `HX-Request`.
- **patterns/** - the TypeScript canon mapped onto the zts subset, one file per pattern. These are the targets of the table in [../docs/typescript.md](../docs/typescript.md#typescript-patterns-in-the-zts-subset).
- **sql/** - the `sql` tagged template from `zttp:sql`.
- **system/** - the cross-handler linking story. The example suite links both
  manifests and rejects handler compilation failures or unresolved links.
- **autoloop/** - the agent autoloop demo (`zttp expert`); the handler deliberately fails a proof so the agent has something to repair (illustrative; not in the gated example suite).

## Running an example

```bash
zig build run -- examples/handler/spec-guardrails.ts -p 3000             # serve
zig build cli -- serve examples/handler/spec-guardrails.ts -p 3000 --watch --prove
zts check examples/handler/spec-guardrails.ts                          # verify once
```

### A note on `zttp check` and these examples

`zttp check` (equivalently `zts check`) runs the strict analyzer. Its
default is to demand a *fully discharged* handler: when a handler declares no
`Proof<T, P>` on its return type, the verifier must prove the entire default
profile, which is all seventeen v1 spec names in
`packages/zts/src/spec_discharge.zig`, and emits **ZTS500** if any member does
not hold. Many examples here are intentionally minimal -
they exist to show one feature (a route, a module import, a JSX component) and
deliberately do *not* carry a `Proof<T, P>`, so they exit non-zero under `check`.
That is expected for those files: the example test harness
(`scripts/test-examples.sh`) replays each `.test.jsonl` for observable
behavior, which is a separate gate from the strict `check` discharge. The
pattern, parallel, SQL, and system examples also run their advertised static
checks because compiler output is part of what they demonstrate.
Workflow fixtures in `examples/workflow/` run as live server checks because the
JSONL replay runner intentionally stubs virtual-module I/O and creates a fresh
runtime per test case.

The canonical example that declares and fully discharges a `Proof<T, P>` - and so
passes strict `check` cleanly - is [handler/handler.ts](handler/handler.ts).
[handler/spec-guardrails.ts](handler/spec-guardrails.ts) also declares a
`Proof<T, P>` and is the magnet to edit interactively under `zttp dev`.
[handler/spec-fails-idempotent.ts](handler/spec-fails-idempotent.ts) declares a
`Proof<T, P>` it cannot hold *on purpose*, to exercise the ZTS500 discharge
diagnostic.

## Diagnosing failures

Every `.test.jsonl` next to a handler is a replayable assertion. Run them with the mock server:

```bash
zttp mock examples/handler/handler.test.jsonl --port 3001
```

When verification fails on an unsupported language feature, the terminal shows the framed restriction block (`why` / `buys` / `try`). See `zts restrictions` for the full table of language cuts and the proofs they unlock.

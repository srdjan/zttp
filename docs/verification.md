# Compile-Time Handler Verification

zttp can statically prove your handler function is correct at compile time. Enabled via `-Dverify` at build time, zero cost when disabled.

## Usage

```bash
# Build with verification
zig build -Dhandler=handler.ts -Dverify

# Combine with other flags
zig build -Dhandler=handler.ts -Dverify -Daot -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
```

Verification runs after parsing and before bytecode generation. If any error-severity diagnostic is found, the build fails with a non-zero exit code. Warnings are reported but do not fail the build.

## Why This Works

zttp's JavaScript subset bans most sources of non-trivial control flow:

- No `while`/`do-while` (no back-edges)
- No `try`/`catch` (no exceptional paths)
- No `goto`, no labeled statements

`break` and `continue` are allowed within `for-of` loops. Both are forward jumps only (break jumps past the loop end, continue jumps to the next iteration) and do not introduce back-edges, so the verification invariant holds.

The only control flow is: `if`/`else` (forward branching), `match` (exhaustive forward branching), `for-of` (bounded iteration with `break`/`continue`), `assert` (guard with early return), and `return` (function exit). The IR tree IS the control flow graph. Verification is a recursive tree walk, not a fixpoint dataflow analysis.

## Checks

### 1. Exhaustive Response Returns

Every code path through the handler must return a Response. The verifier recursively determines whether each statement always, never, or sometimes returns:

- `return` - always returns
- `if` without `else` - sometimes (even if the then-branch returns)
- `if`/`else` where both branches return - always returns
- `for-of` - never (iterable could be empty)
- `var_decl`, `expr_stmt` - never returns

**Triggers when:** the handler body does not always return on every code path.

```
verify error: not all code paths return a Response
  --> handler.ts:2:17
   |
  2 | function handler(req) {
   |                 ^
   = help: ensure every branch (if/else, match/default) ends with a return statement
```

**Fix:** add `else` clauses, `match` default arms, or trailing return statements.

### 2. Result Checking

Values from Result-producing virtual module calls (`jwtVerify`, `validateJson`, `validateObject`, `coerceJson`, `decodeJson`, `decodeForm`, `decodeQuery`, `decodeFormMultipart`) must have `.ok` checked before `.value` or `.unwrap()` is accessed.

The verifier tracks result bindings through the control flow tree:

```javascript
import { jwtVerify } from "zttp:auth";

function handler(req) {
    const token = req.headers.authorization;
    const result = jwtVerify(token, secret, "HS256");

    // ERROR: accessing result.value without checking result.ok
    return Response.json(result.unwrap());
}
```

```
verify error: result.value accessed without checking result.ok first
  --> handler.ts:7:28
   |
  7 |     return Response.json(result.unwrap());
   |                            ^
   = help: check result.ok before accessing result.value:
           if (result.ok) { ... result.value ... }
```

**Recognized patterns for .ok checks:**

- `if (result.ok) { ... }` - direct boolean discriminant
- `if (result.isOk()) { ... }` - method call
- `if (result.ok === true) { ... }` - strict equality
- `if (!result.ok) { return ...; }` - negated early return (code after is safe)
- `if (result.isErr()) { return ...; }` - error early return

### 3. Unreachable Code

Statements after an unconditional return in a block. Severity: warning.

```
verify warning: unreachable code after return statement
  --> handler.ts:4:5
   |
  4 |     const x = 42;
   |     ^
   = help: remove the unreachable code, or restructure the control flow
```

### 4. Unused Variables

Declared variables that are never referenced. Severity: warning. Suppress by prefixing the name with `_`.

The check is scope-aware: a variable used only in a nested scope that shadows an outer declaration does not count as a use of the outer binding.

```
verify warning: unused variable 'temp'
  --> handler.ts:3:11
   |
  3 |     const temp = computeValue();
   |           ^
   = help: remove the variable, or prefix with _ to suppress: _temp
```

### 5. Non-Exhaustive Match

Match expressions without a `default` arm are rejected by strict ZigTS unless the type checker can prove every finite union variant is covered.

```
strict error: match expression must be exhaustive in strict ZigTS
  --> handler.ts:5:12
   |
  5 |     return match (req) {
   |            ^
   = help: cover every finite union member or add an explicit default when the type is not finite
```

### 6. Exhaustive Optional Handling

Four virtual module functions return optional values (`T | undefined`):

- `env("KEY")` - returns `string | undefined`
- `cacheGet("ns", "key")` - returns `string | undefined`
- `parseBearer(header)` - returns `string | undefined`
- `routerMatch(routes, req)` - returns `object | undefined`

The verifier tracks these optional bindings and requires them to be narrowed before use. Using an optional value as a function argument, object property value, template literal expression, or in arithmetic/string concatenation without first checking for `undefined` is an error.

```javascript
import { env } from "zttp:env";

function handler(req) {
    const appName = env("APP_NAME");

    // ERROR: optional value used without checking for undefined
    return Response.json({ app: appName });
}
```

```
verify error: optional value used without checking for undefined
  --> handler.ts:6:30
   |
  6 |     return Response.json({ app: appName });
   |                              ^
   = help: check before use: if (val !== undefined) { ... }
           or provide a default: val ?? "fallback"
```

Property access on an un-narrowed `optional_object` (from `routerMatch`) is also an error:

```
verify error: property access on optional value without checking for undefined
```

**Recognized narrowing patterns:**

- `if (val !== undefined) { ... }` - explicit check narrows in then-branch
- `if (val === undefined) { return ...; }` - explicit check with early return
- `const x = env("KEY") ?? "default"` - nullish coalesce resolves at declaration
- `val = "override"` - reassignment to non-optional clears tracking
- `val?.prop` - optional chaining is safe (not flagged)

### 7. State Isolation (Cross-Request Safety)

The verifier detects module-scope variable mutations inside the handler body. Since handlers are re-invoked per request with fresh scope, mutating a module-level `let` binding would leak state between requests.

The check walks all assignment nodes in the handler body. If the target is an identifier whose binding has a scope_id less than the handler's scope_id (meaning it's declared at module level), the verifier emits a `module_scope_mutation` error.

```typescript
// ERROR: handler mutates module-scope variable
let counter = 0;

function handler(req: Request): Response {
    counter = counter + 1;  // verify error: module_scope_mutation
    return Response.json({ count: counter });
}
```

Fix: use `const` for module-level declarations, or move mutable state to `zttp:cache`.

The result feeds into `HandlerProperties.state_isolated`. When no module-scope mutations are detected, `state_isolated` is proven true, enabling safe multi-tenant handler sharing.

### 8. Author-Declared Proof Discharge

The verifier resolves the handler's active spec set and discharges each
name against the classified `HandlerProperties`. When the handler declares
no `Proof<T, P>`, every supported v1 spec is active by default. A
`Proof<T, P>` on the handler return type narrows the active set to exactly
the names in the annotation. The machinery lives in `spec_discharge.zig`
and runs after the analyzer pipeline so it has access to the full property
set plus the imported module list.

```typescript
structural Guardrails<T> = Proof<T, "idempotent" | "deterministic">;

function handler(req: Request): Guardrails<Response> {
    return Response.json({ now: Date.now() });
}
```

Three diagnostic codes:

- **ZTS500 - spec_not_discharged**: the corresponding property field is
  false. Cause-only specs (`deterministic`, `read_only`, `retry_safe`,
  `idempotent`, `state_isolated`, `fault_covered`, `pure`, `stateless`,
  `result_safe`, `optional_safe`, `cost_bounded`) include a per-property `Try:`
  suggestion. Counterexample-rich specs
  (`no_secret_leakage`, `no_credential_leakage`, `input_validated`,
  `pii_contained`, `injection_safe`) include a falsifying request body.
  `cost_bounded` discharges when the worst-path module-call count has a
  finite envelope; its suggestion points at literal arrays, `range(n)`,
  `.slice(0, k)`, SQL `LIMIT n`, or schema `maxItems`.
- **ZTS501 - spec_incompatible_with_import**: the spec contradicts an
  imported module. v1 fires for `Proof<Response, "read_only">` against
  `zttp:cache` or `zttp:sql`. ZTS500 is suppressed for the same
  name so the agent does not enter repair against a contradiction.
- **ZTS502 - spec_unknown_name**: the declared name is not in the v1
  set.

Diagnostics are stored on `HandlerContract.spec_diagnostics`. Surfaces:
the live HUD, the proof studio (failing pills expand inline to the
ZTS5xx code, source line, and snippet), the proof ledger
(`declaredSpecs: [{name, discharged, diagnosticCode?,
diagnosticMessage?, sourceLine?, sourceColumn?, sourceSnippet?}]` per
swap event; the diagnostic fields appear only on failed specs),
`zts check --json` (`declared_specs` as the effective active set and
`spec_diagnostics` arrays), and the `pi_specs_status` agent tool. See
[user-guide.md](user-guide.md#author-declared-specs) for the author-side
view.

### 9. Proof-Carrying Functions

Spec discharge also runs per helper. A `Proof<T, "...">` annotation on a
helper's return type is discharged against the facts effect inference
and path-return analysis prove about that function (`function_specs.zig`),
for the v1 capsule set `total`, `pure`, `read_only`, `deterministic`.
Helper failures reuse ZTS500 / ZTS502, each carrying a `function`
attribution. A helper that breaks a property the handler's `Proof<T, P>`
demands while carrying no capsule for it gets **ZTS606 -
missing_capsule**: the proof cannot compose across that call boundary.
`computeProperties` intersects the handler's classified properties with
its call-graph-composed effect row, so a property the handler claims
also accounts for every helper it transitively calls. `zts check
--json` adds a `proofCapsules` array; see
[zts-expert-contract.md](internals/zts-expert-contract.md).

Counterexample-rich specs additionally feed a persistent on-disk
corpus. Each falsifying input the analyzer materialises is written
under `.zttp/witnesses/<short_hash>/` so the same logical leak does
not need to be rediscovered next session. See
[Witness Corpus](proofs-and-receipts.md#witness-corpus)
for layout, CLI (`zttp witnesses`), and agent tool (`pi_witnesses`).

### 10. Capability Capsules

`Effects<T, "...">` is the capability dual of `Proof<T, "...">`. Where a
proof property declares a guarantee, an `Effects<...>` annotation
declares a *ceiling*: the function's inferred capability row may be no
wider than the named set. Discharge is the inverse direction of proof
discharge - checked `inferred ⊆ declared` against the row
`effect_inference.zig` computes from real call sites. A reached
capability outside the ceiling is **ZTS503**, an unknown capability name
is **ZTS504**, and a declared-but-unreached capability is the warning
**ZTS505**. The vocabulary is the runtime capability set (`env`,
`clock`, `crypto`, `network`, ...).

The same annotation on the handler's return type is a **budget** that
bounds every reachable helper. A capability the handler reaches directly
outside the budget is **ZTS506**; one a reachable helper introduces is
**ZTS607**, attributed to that helper by `contract_builder.zig`.
The declared budget is recorded in `contract.json` under
`sandbox.declaredBudget`. `zts check --json` adds an `effectCapsules`
array alongside `proofCapsules`.

Where a ceiling goes is decidable rather than optional: an exported function
with a nonempty inferred row must declare one (ZTS610), and a module-internal
function must not (ZTS623), because the compiler infers the internal row and
the handler's budget already bounds it.
The budget and every ceiling are discharged only against inferred facts
from real function bodies, never an assumed claim. The opt-in
`zts check --require-export-capsules` docs mode additionally warns
(**ZTS508**) when an exported helper carries no `Proof<...>` capsule.

### Runtime Optimizations from Verification

Verified properties also control runtime behavior:

- **Route pre-filtering**: proven routes reject non-matching requests at the HTTP layer before entering JS (`contract_runtime.zig`).
- **Response memoization**: when a handler is proven `deterministic` (no Date.now or Math.random) and `read_only` (no write-classified virtual module calls), and its contract shows it reads no request headers or body, GET/HEAD responses are cached in memory and served without JS execution. The header/body condition is required because the cache key is method+URL only: a handler whose response varies on a request header (auth, content negotiation) is excluded so one caller's response is never replayed to another. Cached responses include an `X-Zttp-Proof-Cache: hit` header (`proof_adapter.zig`).

Both rely on the same property that makes verification tractable: the IR tree is the control flow graph, with no back-edges and no exceptions.

## Exhaustive Path Analysis (-Dgenerate-tests)

The `-Dgenerate-tests=true` build option enables compile-time exhaustive path enumeration and fault coverage analysis.

### Path Generator

The `PathGenerator` (`packages/zts/src/path_generator.zig`) walks the handler's IR tree, forking at every branch point (`if`/`match`) and I/O success/failure boundary. Each fork produces a test case representing one complete execution path through the handler. This exploits the same property that makes verification tractable: the IR tree IS the control flow graph (no back-edges).

For Result-producing calls (`jwtVerify`, `validateJson`, `decodeJson`, etc.), the generator forks into both the `ok: true` and `ok: false` paths. For optional-producing calls (`env`, `cacheGet`, etc.), it forks into defined and `undefined` paths.

### Fault Coverage Analysis

The `FaultCoverageChecker` (`packages/zts/src/fault_coverage.zig`) analyzes the generated paths against `FailureSeverity` annotations on each virtual module function:

| Severity | Functions | Meaning |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `critical` | `jwtVerify`, `validateJson`, `validateObject`, `coerceJson`, `decodeJson`, `decodeForm`, `decodeQuery`, `decodeFormMultipart` | Auth/validation failures must not produce 2xx |
| `expected` | `cacheGet`, `env` | Cache misses and missing env vars are normal degradation |

The checker warns when a critical I/O failure path (e.g., `jwtVerify` returning `{ok: false}`) produces a 2xx response. This is a structural pattern overwhelmingly correlated with bugs. Cache misses returning 200 are correctly classified as graceful degradation and do not trigger warnings.

Results appear in:
- `contract.json` under the `faultCoverage` section
- `HandlerProperties.fault_covered` flag
- Deployment manifest tags (`zttp:faultCovered`)
- Build report alongside other PROVEN/--- labels

### Cost Envelope (Multiplicity)

The banned back-edge constructs (`while`, `do...while`, `for(;;)`, recursion)
buy more than termination: they make the worst-path resource cost of a handler
statically computable. `PathGenerator.buildCostEnvelope` folds the multiplicity
of every module call along the enumerated paths into a per-module `CostEnvelope`
(`packages/zts/src/contract_types.zig`). Each bound is a symbolic `Bound`:

- `constant` - exactly `n` calls on the worst path.
- `linear` - `base + coefficient * |source|` calls, where `|source|` is the
  length of one request-derived collection an I/O call loops over. The bound
  carries the loop's source location and the collection name, so a handler that
  calls `sqlOne` inside `for (const id of ids)` reports `1 + 1*|ids|` rather than
  the old `max_io_depth` undercount of `2` (which walked the loop body once).
- `unbounded` - no expressible bound (an unidentifiable iterable, or two dynamic
  collections on one path), carrying the offending loop's location.

The envelope is written to `contract.json` under `costEnvelope`, covered by the
`Zttp-Attest` JWS signature, and composed across `serviceCall` chains by the
system linker (a handler with no envelope composes as `unbounded`, failing
closed). `HandlerProperties.max_io_depth` is kept but made honest: it is set
only when the total bound is constant, else `null`.

A `linear` or `unbounded` bound is dischargeable to `constant` by sizing the
loop source: iterate a literal array, a `range(n)` literal, `Object.keys` of an
object literal, a `.slice(0, k)`, a SQL statement ending in `LIMIT n`, or a
field of a `zttp:validate` schema that declares `maxItems`. When the total
bound is constant or linear with exhaustive path enumeration, the
`cost_bounded` property holds and `Proof<Response, "cost_bounded">` discharges against it;
otherwise the proof card's counterexample names the loop and the discharge
lever.

Results appear in:
- `contract.json` under `costEnvelope`, plus the honest `properties.maxIoDepth`
- The `cost_bounded` proof chip and `Proof<Response, "cost_bounded">` discharge
- The `contract_diff` cost lane: widening a bound to `unbounded` is breaking, a
  bounded widening (`constant` to `linear`) is additive; this reaches
  `prove`, `prove-behavior`, the expert equivalence receipt, and `proofs gate`
- Deployment manifest tags (`zttp:costClass`, `zttp:costBound`,
  `zttp:costSource`, `zttp:costWorstCase` evaluated at `--max-body-size`)
  and the `kind=deploy` receipt
- A runtime cost fuse: the interpreter counts module calls per request at the
  capability-enforcement chokepoint and, on an excess over the proven envelope,
  records a `cost_bounded` soundness incident (log-only, with the arena
  high-water as evidence; it never alters the response)

## Running Tests

```bash
bash tests/verify/run_tests.sh
```

The test suite verifies expected diagnostics from handler files in `tests/verify/`.

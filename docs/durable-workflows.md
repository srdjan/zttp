# Durable Workflows

Durable workflows combine `zttp:durable` with optional `zttp:workflow`
dispatch. They give a handler a stable run key, an oplog for replay, and
operator-visible artifacts that say which replay guarantees the compiler proved.

## Plain Dispatch (No Durability)

`zttp:workflow`'s `call` works on its own, without `zttp:durable`, when a
handler just needs to compose a co-located sub-handler in-process. `call`
dispatches to another handler named in `--system <file>`; it runs in its own
isolated pooled runtime, and its `Response` is copied back before the caller
continues. No HTTP hop, no oplog, no replay:

```ts
// orchestrator.ts
import { call } from "zttp:workflow";

function handler(req: Request): Response {
  const res = call("greet", { method: "GET", path: "/greet" });
  return Response.json({ orchestrated: true, subStatus: res.status, sub: res.json() });
}
```

```ts
// greet.ts - the co-located sub-handler named "greet" in system.json
function handler(req: Request): Response {
  return Response.json({ from: "greet", method: req.method, path: req.url });
}
```

```bash
zttp serve orchestrator.ts --system system.json
```

A sub-handler panic surfaces as a failed call (`subStatus 599`) rather than
taking down the orchestrator. Reach for `zttp:durable`'s `run()` (below)
once a handler needs its dispatch to survive a crash instead of just failing
cleanly.

## Proving Dispatch Links (`zttp link`)

Plain dispatch resolves sub-handler names at runtime, so a typo like
`call("inventroy", ...)` only surfaces as a `599` when that path executes.
`zttp link <system.json>` closes that gap at compile time. It resolves
every `zttp:workflow` `call`, `saga`, and `fanout` target against the
bundle by name - the same resolution `serviceCall` targets get - and reports
any target that names no handler or matches no route in the target's own
route table. A bundle whose targets all resolve signs a `kind=workflow`
receipt.

```bash
zttp link examples/workflow/entry-system.json
```

Targets are extracted strict-literal. `call` and `fanout` read the literal
`method` and `path` from the init object (defaulting to `GET` and `/`) and
synthesize a `METHOD /path` route to match against. A non-literal target, a
non-literal `method`/`path`, or an unrecognized init key keeps the dispatch
dynamic: it is counted but never resolved, downgrading the bundle proof
rather than being guessed at. Only `method`, `path`, `body`, and `headers`
are recognized init keys, and `body`/`headers` carry no proof surface.

### Declaring an entry point

A manifest may name one external HTTP entry point - the single door the
outside reaches, with every other handler reachable only through in-process
dispatch:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "entry": "entry-orchestrator",
  "handlers": [
    { "name": "entry-orchestrator", "path": "entry-orchestrator.ts" },
    { "name": "inventory", "path": "inventory.ts" }
  ]
}
```

`zttp link` checks that `entry` names a real bundle handler, and the
`kind=workflow` receipt attests to it. When the entry handler's own routes
are proven POST-only - a non-empty, statically enumerable
`routerMatch({...}, req)` table whose every route is `POST` - the receipt
records `entryPostOnly: true`. An ad hoc `if (req.method !== "POST")` guard
does not earn that proof; the `routerMatch` convention does. A bundle that
declares no `entry` reports `entryPostOnly: false` instead of being
penalized for a door it never opened.

Both fields are optional and backward-compatible. Manifests without `entry`
link as before. A handler's `baseUrl` is optional too: it feeds only
`zttp:service`'s real-HTTP `serviceCall` and raw `fetchSync` egress, so a
handler reached only by name through `zttp:workflow` never needs one.

## Runtime Model

Enable the oplog with `--durable <dir>`:

```bash
zttp serve examples/workflow/durable-orchestrator.ts \
  --system examples/workflow/system.json \
  --durable ./.durable
```

`run(key, fn)` owns one durable run. `step(name, fn)` records a JSON snapshot of
the step result. `stepWithTimeout(name, timeoutMs, fn)` returns a Result; on
timeout the result is `{ ok: false, error: "timeout" }`. `sleep()` and
`waitSignal()` park a run and return `202` until the timer or signal can resume.

Use `Idempotency-Key` when the client supplies one. The runtime records a small
ledger entry for a matching header and run key. If the compiler cannot prove a
workflow retry-safe or idempotent, a matching idempotency key lets the same
caller retry or reuse the completed response without opening that replay to
other callers.

## Proofs Vs Runtime Guarantees

The analyzer emits `durable.workflow.properties` in `contract.json`:

```json
{
  "durable": {
    "workflow": {
      "proofLevel": "complete",
      "properties": {
        "retrySafe": true,
        "idempotent": true,
        "faultCovered": true,
        "reasons": ["complete durable workflow graph uses stable keys, stable names, and modeled recovery nodes"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

At runtime, only a proof-checked contract can copy a durable property into the
executor. The independent checker promotes each property separately. The
current production policy does not accept `retrySafe`, `idempotent`, or
`faultCovered`, so all three remain unavailable to runtime enforcement.
Without an accepted property, enforcement stays conservative:

- Incomplete replay requires `retrySafe` or a matching `Idempotency-Key`.
- Completed response reuse requires `idempotent` or a matching
  `Idempotency-Key`.
- Unproven replay returns a normal `599` JSON response with
  `DurableRetryUnproven` or `DurableIdempotencyUnproven`.

Proof receipts and deploy manifests expose the producer's reported status.
Those fields are useful evidence, but they are not the runtime acceptance
verdict:

- `zttp verify --json` includes `durableWorkflowProofLevel`,
  `durableWorkflowRetrySafe`, `durableWorkflowIdempotent`, and
  `durableWorkflowFaultCovered`.
- AWS and Cloudflare deploy metadata include the same durable workflow proof
  snapshot.
- `proofTrace.durable_workflow_retry_safe`,
  `proofTrace.durable_workflow_idempotent`, and
  `proofTrace.durable_workflow_fault_covered` explain why a guarantee is
  present or absent.

Two compile-time checks reject a handler outright rather than letting it
ship with a guarantee that only looks proven:

- **ZTS509** - `workflow.call`, `saga`, `fanout`, or `follow` used inside a
  `durable.step()` callback. These exports only durably record at step
  depth 0; nested inside a `step()` they would otherwise silently lose
  durability at runtime with no error. Move the call to the same
  `durable.run()` scope it's already recorded in.
- **ZTS510** - a statically-analyzable `saga([...])` has a non-last step
  with no `compensate`, the structural signature of a partial-rollback
  hole: if a later step fails, that step's already-completed side effect
  is never undone. The last step may omit `compensate` (it never completed
  if it's the one that failed). A saga built from anything other than a
  fully static array of step object literals (a spread, a computed step,
  an externally-referenced step array) is not analyzable and stays
  unproven rather than guessed at - `contract.json`'s `sagas[].dynamic`
  reports this, and `sagas[].compensationProven` is only ever `true` for a
  fully static, fully covered saga.

The most common ZTS509 mistake is putting a child dispatch behind a user
`step()` boundary:

```ts
import { run, step } from "zttp:durable";
import { call } from "zttp:workflow";

function handler(req: Request): Response {
  const key = req.headers.get("idempotency-key") ?? "bad";
  return run(key, () =>
    step("charge", () => call("greet", { path: "/charge" })),
  );
}
```

That is invalid because the workflow queue can only persist top-level child
dispatch inside the `run()` body. Move the child call to durable depth 0:

```ts
import { run } from "zttp:durable";
import { call } from "zttp:workflow";

function handler(req: Request): Response {
  const key = req.headers.get("idempotency-key") ?? "good";
  return run(key, () => {
    const res = call("greet", { path: "/charge" });
    return Response.json({ status: res.status });
  });
}
```

## Durable-Run Recovery and Dead-Letters

`durable_recovery.zig`'s background scheduler retries an incomplete oplog
with jittered exponential backoff. A run that fails ten consecutive times is
quarantined: it stops retrying, and a dead-run record is written next to the
oplog (never inside it) at `<durable>/dead-runs/<id>.json`, with the run key,
the last failure reason, and timestamps.

```bash
zttp durable dead-runs list --durable ./.durable
zttp durable dead-runs show --durable ./.durable <id>
zttp durable dead-runs replay --durable ./.durable <id>
zttp durable dead-runs discard --durable ./.durable <id>
```

A restarted process honors a standing dead-run record instead of forgetting
the quarantine: the in-memory retry count resets on every restart, but the
persisted record does not, so a quarantined run stays quarantined across
restarts until an operator acts on it. `replay` deletes the record so the
next recovery poll retries the run from its untouched oplog; `discard`
instead rewrites the record with `state: "discarded"` (kept on disk for
`show`, excluded from `list`) so the run stays permanently unretried without
silently becoming eligible again on the next poll.

## Workflow Queue

`zttp:workflow` dispatches to co-located handlers from `--system <file>`.
Inside durable `run()`, completed `call`, `follow`, and `fanout` child
responses are recorded so replay does not re-dispatch completed children.

`fanout()` dispatches its calls one at a time, not concurrently - the name
describes the shape of the request (many targets), not parallel execution.
Results are ordered by declaration index regardless of dispatch order. This
keeps the durable oplog boundary simple (the whole fan-out replays as one
step) at the cost of wall-clock speedup; use `zttp:io`'s `parallel()` for
actual concurrent I/O outside a durable workflow context.

There are two queue surfaces with different reliability models:

- `--workflow-queue` persists workflow child dispatch under the durable
  directory. Use it for durable `workflow.call`, `workflow.follow`, and
  ordered `workflow.fanout` boundaries inside `run()`.
- `zttp:queue` is the opt-in actor mailbox module. It isolates handlers and
  passes messages through process-local actor queues; it is not a durable
  workflow queue substitute.

Add `--workflow-queue` to persist top-level child dispatch before it runs:

```bash
zttp serve examples/workflow/dsl-orchestrator.ts \
  --system examples/workflow/system.json \
  --durable ./.durable \
  --workflow-queue
```

The queue lives under `<durable>/workflow-queue`. Items move through
`pending/`, `leased/`, `done/`, and `dead/`. Leases expire and can be reclaimed.
After the attempt cap, the item moves to a dead letter. Dead letters block new
enqueue for the same item id until an operator replays or discards them. The
parent workflow suspends (`202`) while its child is dead-lettered rather than
completing with a terminal error, so the queue item's state and the parent
run's state are separate: `replay`/`discard` only change the queue item, and
the parent request must be retried with the same `Idempotency-Key` afterward
to actually resolve:

```bash
zttp workflow-queue list --durable ./.durable
zttp workflow-queue show --durable ./.durable <item-id>
zttp workflow-queue replay --durable ./.durable <item-id>
zttp workflow-queue discard --durable ./.durable <item-id>
```

`saga()` is intentionally rejected with `--workflow-queue`. Saga step closures
hide dispatch behind a nested callback, while the durable workflow queue tracks
top-level `call`, `follow`, and `fanout` boundaries.

## Fan-out, Follow, and Saga

`fanout()` dispatches several co-located sub-handlers and aggregates their
Responses in declaration order (see [Workflow Queue](#workflow-queue) above
for why it is sequential, not concurrent):

```ts
import { fanout } from "zttp:workflow";

function handler(req) {
  const rs = fanout([
    { name: "greet", path: "/a" },
    { name: "greet", path: "/b" },
    { name: "greet", path: "/c" },
  ]);
  return Response.json({ n: rs.length, first: rs[0].json(), last: rs[2].json() });
}
```

`follow()` resolves a HAL affordance by `rel` instead of hardcoding a target
handler name. The affordance's `href` routes to a co-located sub-handler by
the `"/<name>"` mount convention - `href: "/greet"` routes to the `greet`
sub-handler:

```ts
import { follow } from "zttp:workflow";

function handler(req) {
  const home = resource({ service: "orchestrator" }, {
    self: { href: "/" },
    greeting: { href: "/greet", method: "GET" },
  });
  return follow(home, "greeting");
}
```

`saga()` makes a sequence of in-process calls atomic via reverse-order
compensation. Each step's `run` records as durable step `do:<name>`; if a
step fails (`Response.status >= 400`), the already-completed steps are rolled
back in reverse via their `compensate` thunks (`undo:<name>`). The last step
may omit `compensate` (see ZTS510 above):

```ts
import { run } from "zttp:durable";
import { call, saga } from "zttp:workflow";

function handler(req) {
  const key = req.headers.get("idempotency-key") ?? "saga-demo";
  return run(key, () =>
    saga([
      { name: "reserve", run: () => call("greet", { path: "/reserve" }), compensate: () => call("greet", { path: "/release" }) },
      { name: "charge", run: () => call("greet", { path: "/charge" }), compensate: () => call("greet", { path: "/refund" }) },
      { name: "ship", run: () => call("greet", { path: "/ship" }) },
    ]),
  );
}
```

If a `compensate` thunk itself fails, there is no automatic retry: the
rollback surfaces as a terminal `500` requiring manual intervention, since the
runtime cannot prove which side effects were actually undone.

## Examples

Run the example gate:

```bash
bash scripts/test-examples.sh
```

Workflow fixtures live in `examples/workflow/`:

- `orchestrator.ts` - plain `call`.
- `fanout-orchestrator.ts` - declaration-order `fanout`.
- `follow-orchestrator.ts` - HAL affordance `follow`.
- `durable-orchestrator.ts` - durable child call replay.
- `dsl-orchestrator.ts` - the canonical embedded workflow DSL path: proof
  first, one `Idempotency-Key` run key, one queued child boundary, and one
  inspectable recovery rail.
- `queued-orchestrator.ts` - queued durable child dispatch.
- `queued-fanout-orchestrator.ts` - `fanout()` inside a durable `run()` with
  `--workflow-queue`, so each child call is persisted before it runs, the
  same crash-tolerance a queued top-level `call()` already gets.
- `wait-signal-orchestrator.ts` - signal park/resume, including `signalAt`'s
  scheduled (rather than immediately-delivered) signal.
- `timeout-orchestrator.ts` - deterministic `stepWithTimeout`.
- `scope-orchestrator.ts` - `zttp:scope`'s `using`/`ensure` resource
  cleanup and `scope`'s named nested-scope unwind-before-continuing.
- `saga-orchestrator.ts` - reverse-order saga compensation, including the
  `/compensation-fails` path where the `compensate` thunk itself fails: a
  terminal 500 requiring manual intervention, with no automatic retry.

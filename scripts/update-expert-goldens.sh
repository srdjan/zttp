#
# Regenerate the byte-exact golden fixtures that `zig build test-expert-golden`
# checks the `zts` direct-command JSON/text contract against. Run this ONLY
# after a deliberate contract change (see docs/zts-expert-contract.md); it
# overwrites the fixtures in place with the current binary's output, so review
# the diff before committing.
#
# Each command here mirrors an addExpertGolden/addExpertMetaGolden entry in
# build/goldens.zig. The exit-code-only checks (addExpertExitCheck) do not pin stdout
# and need no fixture, so they are not regenerated here.
#
# Usage (from anywhere; the script cd's to the repo root):
#   bash scripts/update-expert-goldens.sh

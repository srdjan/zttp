# Performance

Current public performance claims and runtime knobs are listed here. Benchmark
history belongs in the benchmark repository or changelog, not in maintained
docs.

## Public Numbers

Measured on Apple M4 Pro with ReleaseFast builds:

| Metric | Current claim |
|---|---:|
| Cold-start floor | about 3.5 ms |
| Typical cold start | about 7-15 ms, host-load dependent |
| Baseline RSS after first response | about 13 MB |
| HTTP throughput on trivial JSON handler | about 112k req/s |
| Deployed local binary | about 4.8 MB |

Cold start is measured from process launch to first complete HTTP response for
`zttp serve -e <handler>`. Treat it as a distribution: scheduling jitter and
host load move the tail.

Run the in-repo benchmark suite with:

```bash
zig build bench
zig build bench-check
```

These commands cover the in-process benchmark suite and advisory threshold
check. The public cold-start, RSS, and HTTP-throughput numbers above are pending
receipt-backed measurement in this repo; until that lands, treat them as
historical/manual benchmark evidence rather than output mechanically reproduced
by `zig build bench`.

For release readiness, treat `zig build bench-check` as an advisory confidence
gate. If one benchmark misses the threshold once, rerun immediately on the same
machine; a clean rerun clears the release, while two consecutive failures block
for investigation.

## What Affects Latency

- Build-time precompile with `zig build -Dhandler=handler.ts` or `zttp build`
  embeds handler bytecode and removes parse/codegen work from startup.
- `-n` controls isolated runtime count. The default is derived from CPU count
  and clamped to 8-128.
- `-m` sets a per-runtime allocator ceiling. The default is no explicit limit.
- `zttp:fetch`, `zttp:service`, `zttp:io`, and durable workflow paths depend on
  external systems and runtime flags.
- `--actor-queue` allocates in-memory mailbox rings only when enabled. The
  default serving path pays no queue-worker or mailbox cost, and queued payloads
  are stored as compact JSON byte slices outside the JS heap.
- Handlers proven deterministic and read-only can serve cached GET/HEAD
  responses from Zig memory.

## Engine Optimizations

The current runtime includes:

- hidden-class shapes for request, response, and object literals;
- polymorphic inline caches for property access;
- binary search for larger object property tables;
- lazy string hashing and pre-interned HTTP atoms;
- specialized bytecode for type-directed boolean and comparison paths;
- request-scoped allocation with bulk reset.

These details are implementation notes, not public API. Use the benchmark
commands above when changing engine or runtime hot paths.

## Deployment Notes

`zttp deploy` produces a local self-contained binary under
`.zttp/deploy/<project-name>`. Run multiple instances behind a reverse proxy
or platform load balancer for higher throughput. A standalone `zttp serve`
process should not be exposed directly without the usual network controls.

For current limits and failure behavior, see [Reliability](reliability.md).

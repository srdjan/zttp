# Sub-handler contract extraction must not inherit the strict profile

## Problem

System sub-handlers need their own contract-derived egress and environment policy. Routing their sources through the general precompiler to extract contracts accidentally imposed the default-on strict ZigTS profile on handlers that had never been subject to that gate.

## Symptoms

- Twenty runtime tests failed on ZTS6xx canonical-profile diagnostics after per-target contract extraction was introduced.
- The failures appeared before pool construction, even though the requested security change was policy derivation rather than stricter source acceptance.

## What Didn't Work

- Calling `compileHandler` with only `.emit_contract = true` was not behavior-preserving. `ResolveOptions.strict` defaults to `true` in `packages/zts/src/pipeline.zig`, so an omitted option enables the strict checker.
- Disabling the boolean or type checker would have weakened real soundness gates. Their failures remain fatal in `packages/tools/src/precompile.zig`.

## Solution

Expose the existing resolver choice through a default-preserving compile option:

```zig
pub const CompileOptions = struct {
    emit_contract: bool = false,
    strict: bool = true,
    // ...
};

var resolved = try zts.pipeline.resolve(
    allocator,
    parsed,
    .{ .type_env = type_env_storage.envPtr(), .service_type_context = stc_ptr, .strict = opts.strict },
);
```

The defaulted boundary that carries this is `ExtractContractOptions.strict` (`packages/zts/src/pipeline.zig:385`), and the sub-handler path is the contract-extraction caller that opts out (`packages/runtime/src/in_process_dispatch.zig:69-73`):

```zig
var contract = try zq.pipeline.extractContract(self.allocator, source, entry, .{
    .strict = false,
    .version = zq.version.string,
    .read_file = zq.file_io.readFileForModuleGraph,
});
```

Note where that call lives. Contract extraction does not go through `precompile` from the runtime at all: commit `58bc8449`, the same change this learning records, moved it into `zts.pipeline.extractContract` so that AOT compilation, deploy manifests, and test generation do not link into the deployed runtime - about 600KB in ReleaseFast. An earlier draft of this doc showed a `precompile.compileHandler` call here; that call never existed in this file, and the binary-size reason is the more useful half of the lesson.

`in_process_dispatch.zig` is not the only runtime caller passing `.strict = false`. `packages/runtime/src/handler_instance.zig:1054-1060` does too, for a different stated reason: strict ZTS6xx is a build-time concern that precompile has already run. That opt-out entered the runtime in `da8fd528` (2026-05-19), before this learning was written.

The `true` default preserves every existing caller. The sub-handler path still fails closed if parsing, boolean checking, type checking, contract extraction, or pool initialization fails; it skips only the canonical-profile diagnostics that were not previously part of that runtime path.

## Why This Works

Strict-profile enforcement and contract extraction are separate concerns. Contract extraction supplies the target-specific allowlist used by `contractToRuntimePolicy`, while `.strict = false` prevents that extraction step from silently expanding the source-language contract. Boolean and type diagnostics are still evaluated and still return `error.SoundModeViolation` on errors.

## Prevention

- When reusing a general compilation pipeline for metadata extraction, audit every default-on validation gate and explicitly preserve the old caller's acceptance contract.
- Keep opt-outs narrow and default-preserving: add a defaulted option at the shared boundary and override it only at the compatibility-sensitive call site.
- Verify with fixtures that distinguish strict-profile diagnostics from boolean/type soundness failures; never make a broad checker opt-out to clear unrelated fixtures.
